# This script is made to be run by the Termux app (for Android devices).  It is recommended you download Termux from F-Droid rather than from the Google Play Store.
# This script will install a PRoot guest system (Ubuntu 20.04) in Termux.  Then it will install box86 and wine-i386 on that guest system.
# Note that this script uses tabs (	) instead of spaces ( ) for formatting since parts of this script use heredoc (i.e. eom & eot).
